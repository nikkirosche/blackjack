//Aim for a playable game. The essence of blackjack requires:
//Two players - a player and a dealer (computer).
//A deck of cards.
//A starting hand of 2 cards for each player.
//Comparing both hands and determining a winner. The possible scenarios are:
//A tie. When both the player and dealer have the same total hand values - or if both draw Blackjack
//A Blackjack win. When either player or dealer draw Blackjack.
//A normal win. When neither draw Blackjack, the winner is decided by whomever has the higher hand total.
